# 10-hour-coding-project
### Created by Morgan Hurley and Bryn Esperson
##### For our ten hour coding project we decided to create a mad libs game, a text based game that allows the user to complete a story by providing the program with words from the parts of speech the program calls for. In our code there are 4 different stories to choose from, all of which were written by us. We have decided to make the project twice, once in Python and once in Java, to represent the different approaches of different languages.
